Description: Heightmap meshing is an efficient triangulation of a raster height map using the 'hmm' library
 a modern implementation of a nice algorithm from the 1995 paper 'Fast Polygonal Approximation of Terrains and 
 Height Fields' by Garland and Heckbert <doi:10.1.1.70.9740>. The meshes produced by hmm satisfy the Delaunay condition 
 and can satisfy a specified maximal error or maximal number of triangles or vertices.
